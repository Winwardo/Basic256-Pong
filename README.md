# Basic256-Pong
A simple implementation of Pong written in Basic256.
You can download Basic256 from <http://basic256.org/>.

The game allows two players. Due to Basic256's simple input, both players cannot hold down keys at the same time, however this should not be an issue.

I'm never writing in Basic again, let alone Basic256. This was an awful experience.
